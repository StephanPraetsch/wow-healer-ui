create a world of warcraft addon that
* add a configuration
  * an icon on the minimap that opens the configuration for this addon
  * add to the configuration an enable/disable toggle for the entire addon
  * the minimap icon is on the outside rim of the minimap and is moveable
* add a group view
  * always shown
  * interactive
    * if I click a player then they will be in my focus
    * if I only hover a player and click a shortcut to do spell then the hovered player is the target (like a macro would do with `/cast [@mouseover,help,nodead] Lay on Hands`)
  * one player cell contains
    * the player name
    * the hp very present (like 80%)
    * the resource (e.g. mana) not that present (like 20%)
    * the item level
    * the cell background color of its class (e.g. mage is light blue)
  * dynamic size: depending on how many players are in the group or raid the size adjusts
  * when I hover a player it's highlighted bright
  * if not in a group nor raid then display only me with header "solo"
  * if in raid
    * header "raid"
    * each group is a column, from left to right
    * each group has the group header with "group <group number>"
    * main tanks are a separate column
  * if in mythic
    * header "group"
    * one column that contains all members
    * sort from top to bottom: tank, healer, damage dealers
  * make it moveable for SHIFT+LEFT CLICK and save the position when releasing
  * highlights a player with white surroundings when there is a debuff that can be dispelled by me
  * highlights a player with orange surroundings when there is a debuff that causes a lot of damage that needs healer focus
* remove the quest log on the right side while the addon is active
  * take care of the initial state, if the addon is active then remove the quest log
* add a frame on the right side (instead of quest log)
  * when I'm in a dungeon
    * line 1:
      * if the mythic plus key hasn't started yet: `<name of dungeon>`)
      * if the mythic plus key has started: `<name of dungeon> +<level of key>`)
    * line 2: "remaining: <mm:ss>"
      * the remaining time for the active key
      * use wow api instead of counting down on your own, see https://github.com/FabysGames/mythicplustimer/tree/master how they did it
    * line 3: "done: <percentage done with 2 decimal digits>%"
    * line 4: "current: <percentage done from line 3 plus the percentage of the current pull with 2 decimal digits>%"
  * when I'm in a raid
    * show all bosses of the current raid instance
      * flag dead bosses as dead
      * flag alive bosses as alive
      * flag the current boss that we are in a fight as in fight
  * when I'm in open world then empty
  * place this frame at (-130, -450) at the right side
  * make it moveable for SHIFT+LEFT CLICK and save the position when releasing
* the name of the addon is "wow-healer-ui"
* the author is "Stephan Pr√§tsch"
* the version is 1.0.0
* create all necessary files (don't forget wow-healer-ui.toc)
* structure the code in a good software architecture way
* use the icon for the addon that identifies holy priest
